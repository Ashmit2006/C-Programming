        -collection of variables of the sametype.
        -Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable,instead of declaring separate variables for each value.



         #Array declaration
            -To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
            -To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces.

              int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};




        #Access the Elements of an Array
            -To access an array element, refer to its index number.
            -Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element, [1] is the second element, etc.  

            int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
            printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);     




        #Array Size
            -To get the size of an array, you can use the sizeof operator.

                int myNumbers[] = {10, 25, 50, 75, 100};
                printf("%lu", sizeof(myNumbers));    




        #Types of Arrays
         -One-Dimensional Arrays
         -Multi-Dimensional Arrays  


           #One Dimensional Arrays
           -An array with only one dimension is called a one-dimensional array.
           -These are the most basic form of arrays, where elements are stored in a linear fashion.

           int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
            printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);



            #Multi-Dimensional Arrays 
           - A multi-dimensional array contains more than one dimension. The most common is a two-dimensional array, which can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.
           int matrix[2][3] = {
                 {1, 2, 3},
                 {4, 5, 6}
                  };
            printf("%d\n", matrix[0][0]); // Accessing the element at the first row and first column
