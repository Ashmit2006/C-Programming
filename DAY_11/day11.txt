   #Pointer
    -A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.

    -A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.

    -The address of the variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer.

    -The & operator is used to get the address of a variable.
