   #Switch Statement
        -Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.


     Syntax:
        switch (expression) {
        case x:
            // code block
        break;
        case y:
            // code block
        break;
        default:
            // code block
        }   



    #Loop
        -In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met.

        C programming has three types of loops:
           1. for loop
           2. while loop
           3. do while loop



        ##for loop
       - A for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration.
       - Syntax:

        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
          // loop body
            }

       -  Entry-controlled loop (the condition is checked before entering the loop body).            
   




        ##while loop
          -A while loop is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code until a condition is satisfied.
          - Syntax:
            while (condition) {
                // loop body
                }
      -    Entry-controlled loop (the condition is checked before entering the loop body).





        ##do While Loop:

            Syntax:
            do {
                // loop body
            } while (condition);

       - Exit-controlled loop (the condition is checked after the loop body has executed, ensuring the loop body runs at least once).
