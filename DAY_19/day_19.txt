   #Passing Arguments by Value
     -When values of actual arguments are passed to the function as arguments,
     it is known as passing by value.



    #Passing Arguments by Address/Refrence
       -When addresses of actual arguments are passed to the function as arguments (instead of values of actual arguments), 
       it is known as passing by address.



    #Recursive Function
    - Within a function body, if the function calls itself, the mechanism is known as “Recursion” and the function is known as
       “Recursive Function”.

    -Recursive functions are functions that call themselves and have two basic parts: a base case and a recursive case:
          Base case: The condition that stops the recursion
          Recursive case: The part where the function calls itself
