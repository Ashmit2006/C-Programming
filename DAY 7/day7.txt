     #Type casting
        -In C programming, type casting is used to convert a variable 
        from one data type to another. 
        There are two types of type casting in C.


        #Types
         -Implicit type casting 
         -Explicit type casting


         1.Implicit Type Casting
            -Implicit type casting, also known as automatic type conversion, is performed by
             the compiler automatically when it encounters a mixed type expression. 


         2.Explicit Type Casting
            -Explicit type casting, also known as type conversion or type casting,
             is done manually by the programmer using a cast operator.



      #Preprocessor Directives
       - In C programming, preprocessor directives are commands that are processed by 
       the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the code begins.
        These directives provide instructions to the compiler to preprocess
         the information before actual compilation starts
