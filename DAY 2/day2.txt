 #Operators
   -Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.



#Types of Operators
    1.Arithmetic operators
    2.Assignment operators
    3.Comparison operators
    4.Logical operators 



1.Arithmetic Operators
   -Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

   Operator 	   Name	        Example	
    +	          Addition		    x + y	
    -	          Subtraction		x - y	
    *	          Multiplication    x * y	
    /	          Division		    x / y	
    %	          Modulus		    x % y	
    ++	          Increment 	    ++x	
    --	          Decrement		    --x



2.Assignment Operators
    -Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

    Operator	Example	    Same As	
        =	    x = 5	    x = 5	
        +=	    x += 3	    x = x + 3	
        -=	    x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
        *=	    x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
        /=	    x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
        %=	    x %= 3	    x = x % 3



3.Comparison Operators
    -Comparison operators are used to compare two values.


    Operator	  Name	                    Example
        ==	     Equal to	                x == y		
        !=	    Not equal	                x != y	
        >	    Greater than   	            x > y	
        <	    Less than	                x < y	
        >=	    Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
        <=	    Less than or equal to	    x <= y



4.Logical Operators
    -Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values, by combining multiple conditions.

    Operator	Name	   Example	
    &&      	AND	    x < 5 &&  x < 10    ---->Returns 1 if both statements are true	
    || 	        OR	    x < 5 || x < 4	-------->Returns 1 if one of the statements is true	
    !	        NOT	    !(x < 5 && x < 10)  ----->Reverse the result, returns 0 if the result is 1
