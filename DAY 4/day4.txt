 #C has the following conditional statements:

   - Use 'if' to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
   - Use 'else' to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
   - Use 'else if' to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
   - Use 'switch' to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



   #if
   syntax: 
     if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
    }


    #else
    syntax:
    if (condition) {
          // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
    }  else {
          // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
    }

    #else if
    syntax:
    if (condition1) {
         // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    } else {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
    }
