    #Function
        -The function is a piece of code that performs a specific task.
        -The function is a reusable block of code.
        

    #Advantages
      1.Manageability
       Easier to write and keep track of.
       Easier to understand and maintain.

    2.Code Reusability
        Can be used multiple times.

    3.Non-redundant programming
       Same function can be called when needed.

    4.Logical Clarity
       Reduced number of code in main function.

    5.Easy to divide work
       Large work can be divided by writing different functions. 

       #Scope of variable
           1.Local Scope
          -It is defined within a function or a block (such as inside a loop or conditional statement) and can only be accessed within that function or block. 
          -It is created when the function or block is entered and destroyed when it is exited.
          
          2. Global Scope
          -A variable with global scope is defined outside of all functions and can be accessed by any function within the same program. 
          -It is created when the program starts and destroyed when the program ends.
